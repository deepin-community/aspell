aspell (0.60.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  The Debian aspell package now contains a "debctrl" filter to make it
  easier to spell-check package descriptions.  It filters out control
  fields so that only the long description part is checked.  To enable
  it, run "aspell --mode=debctrl check ..." or "aspell -D check ..."

aspell (0.60.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  This release begins a transition to support building the dictionary
  binary hashes at install-time.  As part of the transition, the
  location aspell looks for dictionaries has changed from
  /usr/lib/aspell-0.60 to /usr/lib/aspell, and thus all dictionary
  packages need to be rebuilt.
  
  For dictionary package maintainers wishing to rebuild their packages
  immediately to support this aspell, you should make your dictionaries
  provide aspell6a-dictionary and depend upon aspell (>= 0.60.3-2) (and
  not libaspell15c2--see #310590).
  
  For more patient dictionary package maintainers, you may wish to hold
  off rebuilding your package until auto-building the binary hashes is
  fully supported in hopefully a few days.  See the
  dict-common-dev@lists.alioth.debian.org mailing list for progress of
  this support.
