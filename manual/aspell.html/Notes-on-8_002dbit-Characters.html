<h3 class="appendixsec">A.2 Notes on 8-bit Characters</h3>

<p>There is a very good reason I use 8-bit characters in Aspell. Speed
and simplicity. While many parts of my code can fairly easily be
converted to some sort of wide character as my code is clean. Other
parts cannot be.
</p>
<p>One of the reasons why is because in many, many places I use a direct
lookup to find out various information about characters. With 8-bit
characters this is very feasible because there is only 256 of
them. With 16-bit wide characters this will waste a LOT of space. With
32-bit characters this is just plain impossible. Converting the lookup
tables to another form is certainly possible but degrades performance
significantly.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, some of my algorithms rely on words consisting only on a
small number of distinct characters (often around 30 when case and
accents are not considered). When the possible character can consist
of any Unicode character this number becomes several thousand, if
that. In order for these algorithms to still be used, some sort of
limit will need to be placed on the possible characters the word can
contain. If I impose that limit, I might as well use some sort of
8-bit characters set which will automatically place the limit on what
the characters can be.
</p>
<p>There is also the issue of how I should store the word lists in
memory? As a string of 32 bit wide characters. Now that is using up 4
times more memory than characters would and for languages that can fit
within an 8-bit character that is, in my view, a gross waste of
memory. So maybe I should store them is some variable width format
such as UTF-8. Unfortunately, way, way too many of the algorithms will
simply not work with variable width characters without significant
modification which will very likely degrade performance. So the
solution is to work with the characters as 32-bit wide characters and
then convert it to a shorter representation when storing them in the
lookup tables. Now that can lead to an inefficiency. I could also use
16 bit wide characters, however that may not be good enough to hold all
future versions of Unicode and therefore has the same problems.
</p>
<p>As a response to the space waste used by storing word lists in some
sort of wide format some one asked:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since hard drives are cheaper and cheaper, you could store a dictionary
in a usable (uncompressed) form and use it directly with memory
mapping. Then the efficiency would directly depend on the disk caching
method, and only the used part of the dictionaries would really be
loaded into memory. You would no more have to load plain dictionaries
into main memory, you&rsquo;ll just want to compute some indexes (or
something like that) after mapping.
</p></blockquote>

<p>However, the fact of the matter is that most of the dictionary will be
read into memory anyway if it is available. If it is not available
then there would be a good deal of disk swaps. Making characters
32-bit wide will increase the chance that there are more disk swaps.
So the bottom line is that it is more efficient to convert characters
from something like UTF-8 into some sort of 8-bit character. I could
also use some sort of disk space lookup table such as the Berkeley
Database. However this will <strong>definitely</strong> degrade performance.
</p>
<p>The bottom line is that keeping Aspell 8-bit internally is a very well
though out decision that is not likely to change any time soon. Feel
free to challenge me on it, but, don&rsquo;t expect me to change my mind
unless you can bring up some point that I have not thought of before
and quite possibly a patch to solve cleanly convert Aspell to Unicode
internally without a serious performance lost OR serious memory usage
increase.
